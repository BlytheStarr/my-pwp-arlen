<h2>Personas</h2>
    <h3>Joe Carry</h3>
    <p>Jo shmo is an edc enthusiast who recently has purchased a benchmade bugout. He really loves most of the knife's features, but really wishes it felt a little bit more rigid as the scales have a tendency to flex under heavier use. He also hopes to achieve a custom look to make it stand out when he posts about it on social media. He's unsure what a custom bugout would look like but he has heard that custom scales would help solve his issue. Jo is using my site in order to better visualize what a custom knife would look like, as well as possibly contacting me to see how much a custom knife would cost.</p>

    <h3>Jane Nostalgia</h3>
    <p>Jane recently found her old gameboy advance in her parents attic when she was helping them clean out for a garage sale. She has many cherished memories with the console and would love to relive the memories of her youth. Unfortunately she wasnâ€™t as careful with her personal things as she is now in her adult life, and the gameboy is filthy and non-functioning. Jane would use my site first as a resource for what can be done to her beloved childhood console to bring it back to life. She would them be able to contact me about my services and get her gameboy back in working order</p>
