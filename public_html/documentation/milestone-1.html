<h2>Personas</h2>
    <h3>Joe Carry</h3>
    <p>Jo shmo is an edc enthusiast who recently has purchased a benchmade bugout. He really loves most of the knife's features, but really wishes it felt a little bit more rigid as the scales have a tendency to flex under heavier use. He also hopes to achieve a custom look to make it stand out when he posts about it on social media. He's unsure what a custom bugout would look like but he has heard that custom scales would help solve his issue. Jo is using my site in order to better visualize what a custom knife would look like, as well as possibly contacting me to see how much a custom knife would cost.</p>
