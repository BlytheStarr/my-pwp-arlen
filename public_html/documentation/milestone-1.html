<h2>Personas</h2>
    <h3>Joe Carry</h3>
        <p>Name: Joe Carry</p>
        <p>Age: 36 </p>
        <p>Technology: Bone stock benchmade bugout. 2017 macbook pro, Iphone 12, instagram account, twitter account, chrome web browser.</p>
        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Joe is an avid “bushcrafter” and edc enthusiast. Joe uses his various social media platforms to post about his outdoor adventures and his daily “edc” (every day carry) as well as gear he is using.</p>
        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Joe recently bought a benchmade bugout as an every day carry knife that he had hoped to use for some bushcraft as well if needed. He really loves most of the knife's features, but really wishes it felt a little bit more rigid as the scales have a tendency to flex under heavier use. He also hopes to achieve a custom look to make it stand out when he posts about it on social media. He's unsure what a custom bugout would look like but he has heard that custom scales would help solve his issue.</p>
        <p>Goals: Joe is doing research on if the knife he already loves can be improved to give him the features he is looking for. Joe is looking for someone to do the needed work for him, as he isn’t the most mechanically savvy, and a bit nervous at the prospect of taking apart his new $150 knife</p>
        <p>User Story: Joe needs to determine if his knife can be improved upon, and if there is someone who is able to do that for him</p>

    <h3>Jane Nostalgia</h3>
        <p>Jane recently found her old gameboy advance in her parents attic when she was helping them clean out for a garage sale. She has many cherished memories with the console and would love to relive the memories of her youth. Unfortunately she wasn’t as careful with her personal things as she is now in her adult life, and the gameboy is filthy and non-functioning. Jane would use my site first as a resource for what can be done to her beloved childhood console to bring it back to life. She would them be able to contact me about my services and get her gameboy back in working order</p>

    <h3>Jonny Enthusiast</h3>
        <p>Jonny is an aspiring gameboy enthusiast, he currently has a gameboy sp with a front-lit display, but has been seeing on forums the original gameboy advance has a better layout for his adult sized hands, but the unlit display makes it difficult to see in many lighting situations. Jonny has no experience with electronics so he has little confidence in doing the necessary work to solder in a new backlit display, which would make an original gameboy advance his dream system. Jonny will use my site to verify I have the necessary skills to do the modifications, as well as contact me to get a quote on ordering his custom gameboy</p>

    <h3>Julia Personalize</h3>
        <p>Julia enjoys going over to her friends house and playing co-op games, but everyone's control looks exactly the same, so sometimes she accidentally takes her friends' controllers home, and the thought of someone else's cheeto dust in her buttons grosses her out. Julia has never opened up any electronics in her life, but she wants a different colored shell on her controller so she can pick it out from the rest. Julia will use my site to contact me about a simple shell swap to change her controller's color to one of her choosing, and never have to worry about her friends cheeto dust ever again.</p>
