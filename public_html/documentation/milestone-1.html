<h2>Personas</h2>
    <h3>Joe Carry</h3>
        <p>Name: Joe Carry</p>

        <p>Age: 36 </p>

        <p>Technology: Bone stock benchmade bugout. 2017 macbook pro, Iphone 12, instagram account, twitter account, chrome web browser.</p>

        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Joe is an avid “bushcrafter” and edc enthusiast. Joe uses his various social media platforms to post about his outdoor adventures and his daily “edc” (every day carry) as well as gear he is using.</p>

        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Joe recently bought a benchmade bugout as an every day carry knife that he had hoped to use for some bushcraft as well if needed. He really loves most of the knife's features, but really wishes it felt a little bit more rigid as the scales have a tendency to flex under heavier use. He also hopes to achieve a custom look to make it stand out when he posts about it on social media. He's unsure what a custom bugout would look like but he has heard that custom scales would help solve his issue.</p>

        <p>Goals: Joe is doing research on if the knife he already loves can be improved to give him the features he is looking for. Joe is looking for someone to do the needed work for him, as he isn’t the most mechanically savvy, and a bit nervous at the prospect of taking apart his new $150 knife</p>

        <p>User Story: Joe needs to determine if his knife can be improved upon, and if there is someone who is able to do that for him</p>

    <h3>Jane Nostalgia</h3>
        <p>Name: Jane Nostalgia</p>

        <p>Age: 26</p>

        <p>Technology: Broken original gameboy advance, 2012 macbook air</p>

        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Jane is a kind hearted mother who enjoys her time away from work to be spent with family and friends. She gets little downtime between her job and family, so what little free time she does get to herself needs to be meaningful and not require a huge time investment.</p>

        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Jane recently found her old gameboy advance in her parents attic when she was helping them clean out for a garage sale. She has many cherished memories with the console and would love to relive the memories of her youth. Unfortunately she wasn’t as careful with her personal things as she is now in her adult life, and the gameboy is filthy and non-functioning. With her busy work and family life Jane doesn’t have the time to attempt repairing it.</p>

        <p>Goals: Jane is doing research on if it is possible and how much it would cost to have her beloved childhood console repaired, so she can take a trip down memory lane, and possibly pass it on to her children.</p>

        <p>User Story: As a user Jane needs to see if repair is possible of her device and how much it would cost.</p>

    <h3>Jonny Enthusiast</h3>

        <p>Name: Jonny Enthusiast</p>

        <p>Age: 24</p>

        <p>Technology: Functioning gameboy SP ags-001, Iphone 12 pro, high spec gaming pc, chrome browser.</p>

        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Jonny is a smart 24 year old who makes a decent living, but his attention deficit disorder makes some tasks difficult for him if he has ready access to the internet, such as his love for video games. If given the opportunity he will lose focus on whatever game he is currently playing and get sidetracked on various social medias.</p>

        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Jonny already has a gameboy advance sp to fulfill his need of offline entertainment. He has some issues with the gameboy such as the cramped layout which makes long gaming sessions uncomfortable, and the less than ideal image quality of his ags-001 frontlit screen tends to give him eye strain.</p>

        <p>Goals: Jonny is looking into a custom made original gameboy for a more spacious control layout, as well as a much more desirable ags-101 screen added in to improve screen quality to better suit his long gaming sessions.</p>

        <p>User story: as a user Jonny needs to determine what about his gameboy can be different in order to better suit his personal needs.</p>

    <h3>Julia Personalize</h3>
        <p>Julia enjoys going over to her friends house and playing co-op games, but everyone's control looks exactly the same, so sometimes she accidentally takes her friends' controllers home, and the thought of someone else's cheeto dust in her buttons grosses her out. Julia has never opened up any electronics in her life, but she wants a different colored shell on her controller so she can pick it out from the rest. Julia will use my site to contact me about a simple shell swap to change her controller's color to one of her choosing, and never have to worry about her friends cheeto dust ever again.</p>
